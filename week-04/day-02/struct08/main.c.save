// Create a function that returns a dynamically allocated CircularBuffer (the buffer itself should be allocated as well, not just the array inside)

// Create a function that resizes a CircularBuffer, it should take a CircularBuffer as a pointer and change that buffers length and reallocate it's array as well. (copying it's values)
